Okay, I don't mean we should literally ban television. I am not writing my senator to inform them that they should do this.[^1] But do I think the cultural attidudes toward watching television should change. TV should carry a place more like alcohol, where adults can consume it as part of normal life but excessive use is recognized as unhealthy.

# Part I: TV is not good

The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a [survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/a1-2019.pdf) every year where they ask people what they do all day and then average it all out. Did you know that the average American[^2] spends 2.81 hours a day watching television? For reference, the average American spends 3.26 hours working. (Note that nearly twice as many people report watching TV on a given day than working,[^3] so the numbers are 3.61 on TV and 7.60 on work for people who actually do those things.)

The thing is, no one actually needs to watch television. I can't think of a single situation where "you should watch more television" is important and good advice to give someone. At best, the merits of television are:

- consuming good art is an enriching experience
- stories can uplift you emotionally
- you can bond over watching a show with another person
- learning about current events makes you more civically informed
- it is entertaining

I think some of these are valid reasons TV can be good. I would expect something that people expend 12% of their lives on to be a little bit better, but we'll get to that. First I'd like to explain why even some of the virtues of TV are exaggerated.

## 1. No one watches good TV

A lot of people watch Breaking Bad, and The Wire, and whatever else you consider high art in the medium. [More people watch NCIS.](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-popular-tv-shows-of-2019-2020-season-nielsen-ratings-2020-5?op=1#1-ncis-cbs-41) Procedurals, especially police procedurals, dominate the list of the most-watched TV programs of the year. Meanwhile the most responsible-seeming genre, documentaries, makes up only [6%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/201565/most-popular-genres-in-us-primetime-tv/) of the top 250 shows. There are some enriching and meaningful programs on air, but the vast majority of viewing time is  spent on procedurals, comedies, reality shows, news, and sports.

"Chicago PD" is popular, and millions of people seem to enjoy it, but I doubt any of those viewers consider it an intellectually enriching experience. Even some of the most revered shows of all time are more like "really good stories" than "likely to meaningfully improve your life." Even if you give that the benefit of the doubt, though, the picture is pretty bleak.

## 2. TV news is bad

A more civically informed society will elect a better government. News media is one of the institutions that makes people more civically informed. However, cable news is not the format that deserves that reputation. The most popular TV news stations are either slightly partisan or very partisan. (As a corollary to "No one watches good TV", no one watches C-SPAN.) If you're lucky, your local station covers important issues in a relatively informative way, but local stations are dwarfed in popularity by FOX, CNN, MSNBC and the like. Those stations cover "the issues of the day," but they lack the sort of long-term perspective that makes a citizen actually civically informed. The most prestigious and reputable news sources are print, instead—and if you don't think prestige indicates quality of news, then I'm guessing you agreed that cable news is not very informative already.

## 3. Entertainment is the hollowest of virtues

All else held equal, I'd rather be entertained than *not* entertained. But all else is not held equal.

Television is entertaining, but so is getting drunk. Both are worth doing sometimes to have fun, but a life that consists solely of entertainment is not much of a life. Furthermore, without television, life would be boring and suck all the time. Diaries from olden times do not lament, "life's boring, this sucks, when can someone invent the picture box already?" This is either because your ancestors kept themselves entertained without modern technology, or because they were too busy working 12-hour shifts in the mill to care.

There's an argument to be made that entertainment is something like an endgame to humanity. That we've worked hard for millennia, and one day we'll live in a post-scarcity world where everyone entertains themselves all the time. And maybe *Infinite Jest* was a book about a utopia where people got to spend their whole lives entertained.[^4]

## 4. Some concessions

Watching TV with someone else is often a positive activity. It involves another person, and bonding with your fellow human beings is a good thing to do. And if you're really feeling bad, watching TV alone is a better idea than binge drinking. So if it will genuinely make you happier, you should watch TV.

## 5. Doing activities takes time

This is why it matters whether TV is good or merely "not actively bad." Remember the statistics from earlier? 2.81 *hours* per day? That's a lot of time. If you spend 2.81 hours per day from ages 15 to 70 watching TV, that's 6.44 years. If leisure time were a public health crisis, it would be worse than smoking. Of course, spending a lot of time on something doesn't make it bad. We spend even more time working, and even more time than that sleeping, and it's a damn good thing, because humans need to do both of those things to not collapse as a species. But the activities you do should justify the amount of time you spend on them—Do they set you up for future success? Do they make other people happier? Do they produce fond memories? TV can have positive impacts, but in three hours a day almost any activity can produce *some* value.

# Part II: just TV tho?

[Some random marketing firm](https://www.emarketer.com/content/mobile-soon-to-pass-tv-in-time-spent) claims that people now spend more time on mobile devices than watching TV. Their TV numbers are pretty close to what the BLS says for the average day someone watches TV, but I can't find their methodology so I take their absolute numbers with a grain of salt.

![Chart of time spent per day using mobile devices versus watching television](mobile-vs-tv.png)

The estimate of time spent on mobile devices seems high, but not *insanely* high. In contrast, the BLS survey's "non-game leisure computer use" category reports only 15 minutes per day, which is *really low*. It's hard to estimate time spent on digital leisure, because it's not usually spent in continuous chunks like other activities are. The true average time spent is probably somewhere between those numbers. That is to say, time spent on mobile devices is quite a lot in an absolute sense.

![Chart of time spent per day on traditional versus digital media](https://contentstorage-nax2.emarketer.com/e05a73ec882d155aa7309e5e60ec9b61/262670)

This chart includes, I assume, computers, phones, and tablets in the "digital" category. I don't know if it distinguishes work from non-work activity, but if you divide the numbers in that chart by 2, I'm guessing you'd get a pretty good estimate of digital leisure time and television watching.

Digital consumption has its merits, too. Many are the same as the ones I've discussed for TV. But like the hypothesis that no one watches good TV, the most common type of digital leisure is scrolling through a feed[^5] with no particular goal in mind. There are times you see a post and feel more connected with someone, and for each of those there are five Celebrities Going Through Some Drama.

Now, I've been avoiding maybe the strongest argument against my position. The argument is: It's paternalistic as hell. Who am I to decide whether a consenting adult and a consenting media company can engage in entertainment? Everyone is their own person. This blog post is only a step away from this meme:

!["Isn't there someone you forgot to ask" meme](isnt-there-someone-you-forgot-to-ask.png)

But in its strongest form, none but the purest of philosophers believe adults should always do whatever they want. If you read that adults spend 2.81 hours a day injecting heroin between their toes, you'd think "wow, that's messed up." (Unless you were in the middle of your own 2.81 hours.) But even acceptable acceptable, completely legal activities can be bad if done too much. Consider the shame associated with day drinking.

Furthermore, people recognize that media companies use predatory tactics to get people to spend more time on them. Algorithmically arranged, blink-and-you'll-miss-it feeds with unpredictable rewards are intentionally addictive, and they're included in every major social media site.[^6] The tech backlash rightly recognizes this as unethical behavior that causes people to make bad choices for themselves.

Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and nearly all television channels, make money from selling ads. If you sell ads, the best way to be more profitable is to get more people to consume your product for a longer amount of time. When every media company's KPI is time spent... it's no wonder people spend a lot of time consuming media.

The important part is, the time spent *is* the problem. Some of the time that you aimlessly consume TV/digital content, maybe even most of that time, would have gone to something just as bad or worse. Maybe you'd read gossip magazines. Maybe you'd get so bored that you scratch your skin just to feel something. But some of the time, you would instead interact with other people face-to-face, or pursue an enriching hobby, or work and create value for someone else.[^7] This is healthy, and even necessary for health. Not interacting with people makes you isolated; hobbies enrich your character; work helps other people, and sometimes also feels fulfilling.

# Part III: so whadaya want me to do about it

~~Step 1: Join my anarcho-communist Discord server.~~

There are two things you can try to improve. Those are your life, and other people's lives. You might not feel it's particularly pressing to attack either of those. That's ok, and if you think the societal role of TV and digital entertainment is basically fine, you can stop reading. If not, I can offer a couple suggestions, but be warned that I am only a metaphorical green belt in the martial art of attention.

On a personal level, examine your daily time use. Notice when you choose screens over human interaction. When you're hanging out with someone, do you check your phone when you get bored? Do you ever not make plans with people, or not spend time on your hobby, because you're fine binge-watching[^8] TV instead? Everyone has different social needs. Consider whether yours are being met.[^9] In general, notice which things you do are most fulfilling, and try to spend more time on those things and less time on everything else.

At a level slightly beyond the personal, you wield the power to enforce social norms. When you're with other people you can politely ask to do something other than watch TV, and something other than look at your phones in the same room without talking. And if you ever discuss politics with people, you can personally influence $\textrm{the discourse}$. 

In terms of social reform movements, the most comparable in terms of aims is [Temperance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_movement). Obviously there are very big differences in the circumstance: technology is not a religious issue (unless you're Amish or Orthodox Jewish); drunk people cause more problems for others than distracted people; and alcohol is a physical substance that produces clear changes in behavior and health, instead of an abstract category of ways to spend time. A comparison to Temperance doesn't even sound like a compliment, given how Prohibition went. A *good* cultural movement to change attitudes toward entertainment might stem from clusters of local groups focused on non-technological forms of recreation. A swell of blog posts like this one would reflect people changing their beliefs, but the blogosphere and Twittersphere cannot be the ones to make people use technology less.[^10]

So what are you doing? Get outta here. Go outside.
