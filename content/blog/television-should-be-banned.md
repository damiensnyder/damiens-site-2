Okay, I don't mean we should literally ban television. I am not writing my senator to inform them that they should do this.[^1] But do I think the cultural attidudes toward watching television should change. TV should carry a place more like alcohol, where adults can consume it as part of normal life but excessive use is recognized as unhealthy.

# Part I: TV is not good

The Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a [survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/a1-2019.pdf) every year where they ask people what they do all day and then average it all out. Did you know that the average American[^2] spends 2.81 hours a day watching television? For reference, the average American spends 3.26 hours working. (Note that nearly twice as many people report watching TV on a given day than working,[^3] so the numbers are 3.61 on TV and 7.60 on work for people who actually do those things.)

The thing is, no one actually needs to watch television. I can't think of a single situation where "you should watch more television" is important advice to give someone. At best, the merits of television are:

- consuming good art is an enriching experience
- stories can uplift you emotionally
- you can bond over watching a show with another person
- learning about current events makes you more civically informed
- it is entertaining

I think some of these are valid reasons TV can be good. I would expect something that people expend 12% of their lives on to be a little bit better, but we'll get to that. First I'd like to explain why even some of the virtues of TV are exaggerated.

## 1. No one watches good TV

A lot of people watch Breaking Bad, and The Wire, and whatever else you consider high art in the medium. [More people watch NCIS.](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-popular-tv-shows-of-2019-2020-season-nielsen-ratings-2020-5?op=1#1-ncis-cbs-41) Procedurals, especially police procedurals, dominate the list of the most-watched TV programs of the year. At only 6% of the top 250 shows, documentaries are the [least popular genre](https://www.statista.com/statistics/201565/most-popular-genres-in-us-primetime-tv/) of TV programs. Generally speaking, 90% of what people watch on TV is procedurals, comedies, reality shows, news, and sports. That number might not be an exaggeration.

While you can watch "Chicago PD" all you want, I hope you do not consider it an intellectually enriching experience. Even some of the most revered shows of all time seem to be more like "really good stories" than "improved my life in a meaningful way beyond being entertaining", but even if you give that the benefit of the doubt the picture is pretty bleak.

## 2. TV news is bad

I won't contend with the point that a more civically informed society will elect a better government. However, I will contend with the idea that TV news makes people more civically informed at all. First, note that the most popular TV news stations are either slightly partisan or very partisan. (As a corollary to "No one watches good TV", no one watches C-SPAN.) My contempt for 24-hour news is bleeding through, but no one is making better-informed voting choices because they watch CNN/FOX/MSNBC more often. The most prestigious and reputable news sources are all print, and if you don't think that prestige indicates quality of news then I'm guessing you agreed with me on "TV news is bad" already.

## 3. Entertainment is the hollowest of virtues

All else held equal, I'd rather be entertained than *not* entertained. But all things are not held equal.

Television is entertaining in the same sense that alcohol is entertaining. It can be worth doing sometimes to have fun, but a life that consists of television is not much of a life at all. Furthermore, I'm not convinced that without television life would be boring and suck all the time. You might be bored more often, but sources inform me that 1800s diaries were not filled with "life's boring, this sucks, when can someone invent the TV already." Maybe they were too busy working 12-hour shifts in the mill to care, I dunno. But I think entertainment value is an extremely weak argument for anything

---

I will recognize "watching TV with someone else" as often a positive activity. The key reason is that it involves another person, but whatever gets the job done works for me. And if you're really feeling down, watching TV alone is probably better than binge drinking. So if you think it will genuinely make you happier, go ahead and watch TV. But my conviction is that in the long run television is kind of a bad thing.

Remember the statistics from earlier? 2.81 *hours* per day? That seems really alarming, and I hope not just to me. If you spend 2.81 hours per day from ages 15 to 70 watching TV, that's 6.44 *years*. If leisure time were a public health crisis, it would be worse than smoking. Of course, leisure time is not a public health crisis. I could make the same case for, say, sleeping—if we just didn't sleep, we could have 50% more time, *whooaaa*—but the other things we spend 3 hours a day on seem to be much more obviously valuable. Or maybe not. Maybe *Infinite Jest* was actually a book about a utopia where people got to spend all their time entertained.[^4]

# Part II: just TV tho?

[Some random marketing firm](https://www.emarketer.com/content/mobile-soon-to-pass-tv-in-time-spent) claims that people now spend more time on mobile devices than watching TV. Their TV numbers are pretty close to what the BLS says for the average day someone watches TV, but I can't find their methodology so I take their absolute numbers with a grain of salt.

![Chart of time spent per day using mobile devices versus watching television](mobile-vs-tv.png)

Anecdotally, the time spent on mobile devices seems fairly accurate for people like me, but for example my mother certainly does not use a mobile device for over three hours per day. It is probably much closer to accurate than whatever you could hope to infer from BLS. That's because the BLS survey's "non-game leisure computer use" category reports only 15 minutes per day, which is obviously too low for anyone I've met under the age of 50. Part of it is that people are unlikely to form good estimates, or any estimates at all, about time spent on social media or whatever. I expect most people surveyed report their time in blocks, so they'd say that they worked from 8:30 to 4:30 instead of, "I got to work at 8:35 but I checked my phone for a few minutes, then I caught up with a coworker so it didn't really get started until 8:46..." This is conjecture, but average non-game leisure computer use (including phones) is definitely way above 15 minutes per day.

![Chart of time spent per day on traditional versus digital media](https://contentstorage-nax2.emarketer.com/e05a73ec882d155aa7309e5e60ec9b61/262670)

This chart includes, I assume, computers, phones, and tablets in the "digital" category. I don't know if it distinguishes work from non-work activity, and I don't mean to rag on people checking their email or whatever. But if you divide the numbers in that chart by 2 I'm guessing you'd get a pretty good estimate of digital leisure time and television watching.

And, like with TV, digital consumption has its own merits, many of them the same. But like with the "No one watches good TV" hypothesis, the most common use of technology is scrolling through some sort of feed[^5] without any particular goal in mind. For every time you feel slightly more connected to a friend you couldn't see in person, you scroll past five boring vacation photos.

Now, I've been avoiding maybe the strongest argument against my position. The argument is, it's paternalistic as hell. Who am I to decide whether a consenting adult and a consenting media company engage in entertainment? Everyone is their own person. I feel like what I'm writing is only a step away from this meme:

!["Isn't there someone you forgot to ask" meme](isnt-there-someone-you-forgot-to-ask.png)

But in its strongest form, none but the purest of philosophers believe adults should always do whatever they want. If you read that adults spend 2.81 hours a day injecting heroin between their toes, you'd think "wow, that's messed up." (Unless you were in the middle of your 2.81 hours.) Even with completely legal activities, people recognize that acceptable things can be bad if used too much. Watching cable news for two hours straight is the technological equivalent of day drinking, but few people treat it as such.

Furthermore, people recognize that media often uses predatory tactics to get people to spend more time on them. Algorithmically arranged, blink-and-you'll-miss-it feeds with unpredictable rewards—these are intentionally addictive tactics, and prevalent in all the major social media sites.[^6] The tech backlash rightly recognizes this as unethical behavior that causes people to make bad choices for themselves.

Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and nearly all television channels, make money from selling ads. If you sell ads, the best way to be more profitable is to get more people to consume your product for a longer amount of time. When every media company's KPI is time spent... it's no wonder people spend a lot of time consuming media.

The important part is, time spent *is* the devil. Some of the time you aimlessly consume TV/digital content, maybe even most of the time, you would've been doing something equivalently bad or worse. Maybe you'd be so bored you start scratching your skin just to feel something. But some of the time, you would interact with other people face-to-face, or pursue an enriching hobby, or work and create value for someone else.[^7] This is healthy, and even necessary for health. Not interacting with people makes you isolated; hobbies enrich your character; work helps other people, and sometimes also feels fulfilling.

# Part III: so whadaya want me to do about it

~~Step 1: Join my anarcho-communist Discord server.~~

There are two things you can try to improve. Those are your life, and other people's lives. You might not feel it's particularly pressing to attack either of those. That's ok, and if you still think the societal role of TV and digital entertainment is basically fine, you can stop reading. If not, I can offer *some* guidance, but be warned that I am only a metaphorical green belt in the martial art of attention.

On a personal level, examine your daily time use. Notice when you choose screens over human interaction. When you're hanging out with someone, do you check your phone when you get bored? Do you ever not make plans with people, or not spend time on your hobby, because you're cool just binge-watching[^8] TV instead? Obviously everyone has different social needs. Consider whether yours are being met.[^9] In general, notice which things you do are most fulfilling, and try to spend more time on those things and less itme on the things that aren't fulfilling to you.

At a level slightly beyond the personal, you wield the power to enforce social norms. When you're with other people you can politely ask to do something other than watch TV, and something other than look at your phones in the same room without talking. In whatever political discussions you're in, you can influence $\textrm{the discourse}$. 

In terms of social reform movements, probably the most comparable in terms of aims is [Temperance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_movement). Obviously there are some very big differences in the circumstance: technology is not a religious issue (except for Amish, Orthodox Jewish, and some other people); drunk people cause more problems for others than distracted people; and alcohol's danger is clearly physical and not just psychological. Being compared to Temperance doesn't even sound like a compliment, given how Prohibition went. A *good* cultural movement to change attitudes toward entertainment might stem from clusters of local groups focused on non-technological forms of recreation. A swell of blog posts like this one would reflect people changing their beliefs, but the blogosphere and Twittersphere cannot be the ones to make people use technology less.[^10]

So what are you doing? Get outta here. Go outside. That's what I'm about to do.
