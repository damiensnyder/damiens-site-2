# who are you

damien snyder

# be more specific

i'm a college student who makes music, videos, writing, and code. mostly code
nowadays. planning to spend my life doing effective altruism but right now i'm
in the "daunted by all the possibilities" phase.

# what is this

my site where i post things

# be more specific

have you ever seen a website before? it's like one of those, but everything on
it is made by me. i made it custom because i like unnecessary work.

# how'd you make it

next.js and duct tape. the whole site is hosted in a repo
[here](https://github.com/damiensnyder/personal-website). except the static
assets which i host elsewhere

# be more specific

the site is hosted on Vercel, except the static assets which are hosted on
AWS S3. it auto-deploys whenever i push to my git repo. the blog posts are
rendered with Remark and the GFM, footnotes, and KaTeX plugins. everything else
i made for myself. look at the source code to find out my secrets. oh and pro
tip, don't make a site entirely from scratch

# how do i check for new updates

true stans refresh every four hours

# pls

there is an RSS feed for [the whole site](/rss.xml), as well as feeds for
[just blog posts](/blog/rss.xml), [just videos](/videos/rss.xml),
[just songs](/songs/rss.xml), and [miscellaneous](/misc/rss.xml). there's also
my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_JMabjdOb2k57k5pvHnfEg),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/damien__snyder),
[SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/damiensnyder), and
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/damien__snyder).

# how do i contact you

[email](mailto:damien@damiensnyder.com), but my email setup is broken half the
time so a better idea would be to message me at any of the social media
platforms. or know me in real life, that one usually works

# why is the text so big

i like it that way

# the part where the FAQ question asker breaks the fourth wall

whew. glad that's over
